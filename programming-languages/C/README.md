# Learning C Programming 🧠🔧

Welcome!  
This repository is a personal space where I document and share my journey of learning the C programming language. C is a powerful, low-level language that plays a key role in systems programming, embedded systems, operating systems, and more.

## 📌 Why C?

As a computer engineering student focusing on embedded systems, learning C is a must. It helps me understand how hardware and software interact, and how to write efficient, low-level code that can run directly on microcontrollers or operating systems.

## 🧭 Learning Path

This repo is organized according to the topics I studied while learning C. Some examples include:

- 🟢 Basic Syntax & Hello World
- 🔢 Variables, Data Types & Constants
- 🔁 Conditionals & Loops
- 📦 Functions
- 📚 Arrays, Strings
- 🎯 Pointers & Memory Management
- 🧱 Structs, Enums, Typedef
- 📁 File I/O
- 🧠 Advanced Topics (Bitwise Operations, Command-line Arguments, etc.)

## 🛠️ How to Compile

To keep everything in a single file, some parts of the code (e.g., main functions or conflicting definitions) are commented out. This file is not meant to be compiled directly as-is. Please uncomment and modify the relevant sections depending on which example or feature you'd like to run.
