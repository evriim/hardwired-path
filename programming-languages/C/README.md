# 🖥 C Programming — Hardwired Path

This section focuses entirely on the **C programming language**, covering:
1. Step-by-step lessons on C fundamentals
2. Example codes for each topic
3. Small-to-large scale projects written in C

---

## 📖 Purpose
C is the backbone of **embedded systems programming**.  
This section is designed to give you:
- A clear **learning sequence**
- Practical **example programs**
- **Projects** to apply your knowledge

## 🗺 Learning Modules

### 1️⃣ Basics
- Variables, constants, and data types
- Operators (arithmetic, logical, bitwise)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)

### 2️⃣ Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Function parameters (by value, by reference)
- Scope and lifetime of variables

### 3️⃣ Pointers
- Introduction to pointers
- Pointer arithmetic
- Pointers with arrays and strings
- Function pointers

### 4️⃣ Memory Management
- Stack vs heap
- `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `free()`
- Avoiding memory leaks

### 5️⃣ Data Structures
- `struct` and `typedef`
- `enum` usage
- Linked lists, queues, stacks

### 6️⃣ File I/O *(Optional for Embedded)*
- Opening, reading, writing files
- Binary vs text mode
