# Learning C++ 🧠🚀

Welcome!  
This repository contains my personal notes and practice code while learning the C++ programming language. It is part of my journey to strengthen my low-level programming skills and understand how things work under the hood — especially for systems and embedded development.

## 📌 Why C++?

C++ combines the power of low-level memory control with the structure of high-level programming. It's widely used in:

- Embedded systems
- Game development
- Operating systems
- High-performance applications

As a computer engineering student, learning C++ helps me build a deeper understanding of both hardware and software interaction.

## 🔧 How to Compile and Run C++ Code
To keep everything in a single file, some parts of the code (e.g., main functions or conflicting definitions) are commented out. This file is not meant to be compiled directly as-is. Please uncomment and modify the relevant sections depending on which example or feature you'd like to run.
