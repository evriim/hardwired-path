# 🔌 Hardwired Path  
*A Practical Roadmap for Learning Embedded Systems*

---

## 📖 About This Repository
**Hardwired Path** is a structured and practical learning roadmap for anyone who wants to dive into **embedded systems development**.  
It is built from my personal learning journey as a computer engineer, covering both **theory** and **hands-on coding**.  

You will find:
- Step-by-step roadmap from beginner to advanced
- Practical code examples in C and C++
- Arduino, STM32, and bare-metal programming guides
- Algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving approaches
- Basic electronics and microcontroller fundamentals

The goal:  
> To help learners move from *"blinking an LED"* to *"building robust embedded applications"*.

## 🗺 Roadmap Overview
The learning path is divided into **main categories**:

1. **Programming Languages**  
   - [C](programming-languages/C/README.md)  
   - [C++](programming-languages/C++/README.md)

2. **Algorithms**  
   - Sorting, searching, data structures

3. **Hardware Platforms**  
   - [Arduino](hardware-platforms/arduino/README.md)  
   - [STM32](hardware-platforms/stm32/README.md)  
   - [Bare-Metal Programming](hardware-platforms/bare-metal/README.md)

4. **Basic Electronics**  
   - Ohm’s Law, resistors, transistors, power supply basics

5. **Microcontroller Fundamentals**  
   - Architecture, memory, clock systems, peripherals

6. **Projects**  
   - Complete real-world embedded projects
