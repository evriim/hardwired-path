# Learning Arduino Programming ⚙️🔌

**Welcome!**  
This folder contains my practice code and personal projects developed using the Arduino platform.  
Arduino is a beginner-friendly way to explore embedded systems through real-world electronics and hands-on coding.

## 📌 Why Arduino?

Arduino offers a simple and accessible gateway into the world of embedded systems.  
By abstracting many hardware-level details, it allows for fast prototyping and intuitive learning.

As someone studying computer engineering and focusing on embedded development, Arduino helped me to:

- Understand how microcontrollers interact with real-world components
- Learn digital and analog I/O
- Explore communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART)
- Build sensor-based and real-time systems

## 🧭 Learning Path

This section is organized based on what I learned and built using Arduino:

- 🟢 Basic Syntax & Setup  
- 💡 Digital and Analog Input/Output  
- 🌡️ Sensor Projects (temperature, distance, light)  
- 📶 Communication Protocols (I2C, SPI, Serial)  
- 🧱 Motor and Servo Control  
- 🤖 Small Robotics & Actuators  
- 📁 Mini Projects & Prototypes

## 🎥 Resources I Followed

Here are some of the tutorials and guides I used while working with Arduino:

- [Official Arduino Documentation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage)  
- [Course developed by Ashish Bansal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ-LqeX_fLU&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) 
- Sensor and module datasheets  
- Community forums and blog posts

## 🛠️ How to Upload & Run

Most code is written for Arduino Uno and tested via the **Arduino IDE**.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> Some example files contain multiple function variations or demo sections.  
> Comment/uncomment the relevant lines before uploading to your board.  
> Make sure to select the correct board and port from the **Tools** menu in the IDE.

## 🔧 Hardware Used

- Arduino UNO / Nano / Mega  
- Breadboards, jumper wires  
- Basic components (LEDs, resistors, buttons)  
- Sensors (DHT11, HC-SR04, LDR, etc.)  
- Actuators (Servos, DC motors)
