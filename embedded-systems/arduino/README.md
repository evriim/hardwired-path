# Arduino Projects & Examples 🔌🔧

This folder contains my Arduino-based projects and practice code.  
Arduino is an excellent starting point for exploring embedded systems, especially for hands-on learning with real hardware.

## 🧠 Why is Arduino under "Embedded Systems"?

Although Arduino provides high-level abstraction and beginner-friendly tools, it is fundamentally based on **microcontroller programming**, which is the core of embedded systems.

> Think of Arduino as a **gateway** to deeper embedded development.

By working with Arduino, I learned:
- How sensors and actuators work
- Basic digital/analog I/O
- Communication protocols like I2C, SPI, and UART
- Real-time behavior, delays, and interrupts

## 🛠️ Notes

* All code is written as part of my personal learning.
* Projects are kept simple and readable.
* Some code may include comments in Turkish 🇹🇷.

## 🚀 Next Steps

Arduino is my entry point to embedded systems.
As I progress, I also work on more advanced platforms like STM32 and write low-level C code without abstraction layers.

See:
[../stm32](../stm32)
[../bare-metal-c](../bare-metal-c)
